.Sh NAME
.Nm portmap
.Nd
.Tn DARPA
port to
.Tn RPC
program number mapper
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm portmap
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl v
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Portmap
is a server that converts
.Tn RPC
program numbers into
.Tn DARPA
protocol port numbers.
It must be running in order to make
.Tn RPC
calls.
.Pp
When an
.Tn RPC
server is started, it will tell
.Nm portmap
what port number it is listening to, and what
.Tn RPC
program numbers it is prepared to serve.
When a client wishes to make an
.Tn RPC
call to a given program number,
it will first contact
.Nm portmap
on the server machine to determine
the port number where
.Tn RPC
packets should be sent.
.Pp
.Nm Portmap
must be started before any
.Tn RPC
servers are invoked.
.Pp
Normally
.Nm portmap
forks and dissociates itself from the terminal
like any other daemon.
.Nm Portmap
then logs errors using
.Xr syslog 3 .
.Pp
Option available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
(debug) prevents
.Nm portmap
from running as a daemon,
and causes errors and debugging information
to be printed to the standard error output.
.It Fl v
(verbose) run
.Nm portmap
in verbose mode.
.El

This
.Nm portmap
version is protected by the
.Nm tcp_wrapper
library. You have to give the clients access to
.Nm portmap
if they should be allowed to use it. To allow connects from clients of
the .bar.com domain you could use the following line in /etc/tcpd/hosts.allow:

portmap: .bar.com

You have to use the daemon name 
.Nm portmap
for the daemon name (even if the binary has a different name). For the
client names you can only use the keyword ALL or IP addresses (NOT
host or domain names).

For further information please have a look at the
.Xr tcpd (8) ,
.Xr hosts_allow (5)
and
.Xr hosts_access (5)
manual pages.

.Sh BUGS
If
.Nm portmap
crashes, all rpc servers must be restarted.
